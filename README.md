AutoIt-Projects
===============

Some AutoIt projects that I've done and am working on.
<br>*AuPad -- A full service notepad with an IDE-like syntax highlighting for developing AutoIt code as well.
<br>Short Order Encrypter -- A program that will take a file and encrypt it based on the chosen encryption method.
<br>CPU Monitor -- monitors CPU temp and creates a drawn graph to show in a GUI.*
